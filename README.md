## Recipes App made with React

This was a group project developed in the [Software Development Course at Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/formacao-desenvolvimento-web). In this project we were able to catch recipes of foods and drinks from the [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) and [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) and used React to show our Recipes and the users should be able to start a recipe, mark as favorite and finish it.
